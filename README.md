# TrafficCV
TrafficCV is a small OpenCV-based cross-platform program and library that runs different object detection models on live streams or videos of traffic to compute and extract traffic information such as vehicle speed, vehicle class, and the number of vehicles passing through a Region of Interest (ROI). You specify the model to run using the `--model` parameter and the video source using the `--video` parameter together with an optional --args parameter that specifies a comma-delimited set of model and detector arguments in the form key=value. . 
  
TrafficCV can run models on traffic videos from youtube and other video hosting sites using VLC which is installed by default on the Raspberry Pi. The vlc-stream scripts accept as a parameter a file or URL and then creates a Multipart-JPEG (MPJPEG) stream on the current computer on port 18223. MPJPEG is a simple way to stream Motion-JPEG (M-JPEG) encoded videos over HTTP that can be processed by OpenCV. Any video source which can be decoded by VLC can be transcoded and streamed to OpenCV allowing TrafficCV to analyze videos in many different formats and locations.
